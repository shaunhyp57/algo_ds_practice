        "Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly $n$ steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, $U$, or a downhill, $D$ step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a $1$ unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:\n",
